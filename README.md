# Imaginative Go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonyarianto/imaginative-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonyarianto/imaginative-go)

Imaginative Go is a website that created with Go lang. It contains many go lang working samples that for web and non-web application. It demonstrate what Go lang can achieve. You can contribute!

> I believe that the best way to learn new programming language is by directly implement the knowledge into a project.<br>
> -- Sony Arianto Kurniawan, Imaginative Go Project Maintainer

This imaginative project will show doing web application in Go lang as well as other samples that not related to web. We don't use any framework and forgive us if the code still not efficient or optimal, since it just give you an idea how to achieve something in Go lang.

## Why Imaginative Go?
- Ideas about achieve something with Go language
- Plenty of working code samples (awwww, currently still not plenty, relaxxx mann)
- Easy to run in local (with Docker)
- You can contribute

## Requirements (Optional)
- Docker Engine (version 17.03.0 or later)
- Docker Compose (version 1.22.0 or later)

Docker is used since it will create additional service to mimic realistic web sample, such as query to database (SQL/NoSQL). Imaginative Go is using MySQL and MongoDB container with pre-populated data.

For those who need documentation of Docker installation, please refer to [Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

> **NOTE:** `sudo` used throughout this doc, since mainly we use Linux/MacOS.

## Usage
#### Linux/MacOS
```
git clone https://github.com/sonyarianto/imaginative-go.git
cd imaginative-go
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

After that, go to your browser and type
```
http://localhost:9899
```

> **Note 1**
> 
> To clean containers (stop and remove), remove volume, clean network (remove), pull, build (with no cache) and bring up all containers you can type like below
> ```
> sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker volume rm imaginative-go_volume-mongodb-imaginative-go && sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose build && sudo docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate
> ```
> Above command will make sure you will create and run fresh all containers needed to run Imaginative Go web project. This is usualy useful after you are doing `git pull` on Imaginative Go repository.

> **Note 2**
> 
> MongoDB expose random port to host machine. You can see it by typing this after all containers are running.
> ```
> sudo docker ps -f "name=mongodb-imaginative-go"
> ```
> Sample output is like below
> ```
> CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                NAMES
